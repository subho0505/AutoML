# 📊 OperationalML

OperationalML is a **Streamlit-based Machine Learning automation app** that allows you to upload datasets, perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Pandas Profiling, automatically build ML models using **PyCaret**, and download the best model with a single click.

## 🚀 Features

* 📂 **Upload Dataset:** Easily upload CSV datasets.
* 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Generate detailed profiling reports using `pandas-profiling`.
* 🤖 **AutoML Modelling:** Use `PyCaret` to automatically compare ML models and select the best one.
* 💾 **Download Trained Model:** Save and download the best-performing model in `.pkl` format.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - UI Framework
* [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) - Automated Machine Learning
* [Pandas Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) - EDA Reports
* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - Interactive Visualizations
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data Handling

## 📌 Installation

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OperationalML.git
cd OperationalML
```

2️⃣ **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

```bash

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3️⃣ **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

✅ **Dependencies include:**

```
streamlit
pandas

plotly
```

## ▶️ Usage

1️⃣ **Run the Streamlit app**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2️⃣ **Navigate through the options:**

* **Upload:** Upload your dataset (CSV format).
* **Profiling:** Perform automated EDA.
* **Modelling:** Select target column and let PyCaret train and compare models automatically.
* **Download:** Download the best model as a `.pkl` file.
